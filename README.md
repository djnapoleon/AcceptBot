[Release] Steam Friend Request Accept Bot
Hello all :)

I made this for a friend a few months ago, and I've decided to post it here if anyone thinks they might find it useful!

This bot will automatically accept friend requests, and send them a greeting message (configurable). You can also set it to remove friends after accepting them, after a configurable time period.

Finally, you can set it to respond automatically to any messages you receive AND you can set the game it is 'playing'.

And all of the configuration is made available to you through a web-page application hosted on port 8080 (which also has a live console feed on it)!

If you have any ideas for anything I could add to it, feel free to comment :)

Installation Instructions:

1. Install Node.js.

2. Extract the .zip file somewhere.

3. In the folder, open a terminal / command prompt and run npm install to install the required packages. To do this on Windows, shift + right-click in a folder and select 'Open command window here' or 'Open Powershell window here'.

4. Configure your Steam account in the settings.json file. Note: Leave 'sharedSecret' empty if you do not know what it is.

5. If on Windows, simply double-click run.bat to run the bot, or on Linux / other OS open a terminal in the folder and run node index.js.

There is no statistics tracking or any other way for me to interfere with this bot. It is purely for you to use.

Enjoy!

If anyone needs help just comment or PM :)
